    "orward propagation in a neural network serves the purpose of computing the output of the network given a set of input data. \n",
    "During forward propagation, the input data is passed through the network layer by layer, with each layer applying a series of transformations to the input data until it reaches the output layer. These transformations involve the weighted sum of inputs followed by the application of an activation function. The final output produced by the network is then used for tasks such as classification, regression, or any other relevant task the network is designed for. In essence, forward propagation enables the network to make predictions or perform tasks based on the learned patterns and relationships within the input data."

    "Q3. How are activation functions used during forward propagation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation functions are used during forward propagation in neural networks to introduce non-linearity into the output of each neuron or node in the network. Without activation functions, the network would simply be computing linear transformations of the input data, and stacking multiple layers of such transformations would still result in a linear model overall. Activation functions allow neural networks to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how activation functions are used during forward propagation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Weighted Sum Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each neuron in a neural network calculates a weighted sum of its inputs. This is done by multiplying each input by its corresponding weight and summing up the results. The weighted sum is represented as z.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Application of Activation Function: Once the weighted sum z is computed, an activation function f(z) is applied to it. This introduces non-linearity into the output of the neuron. The purpose of the activation function is to determine whether the neuron should \"fire\" or not based on its input. Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and softmax, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the sigmoid function squashes the output of the neuron to the range (0, 1), which can be interpreted as a probability. The ReLU function outputs the input if it is positive, otherwise, it outputs zero. These non-linearities allow the network to model complex relationships in the data.\n",

    "Q4. What is the role of weights and biases in forward propagation?\n",
    "\n",
    "In forward propagation, weights and biases play crucial roles in transforming input data through the layers of a neural network to produce meaningful output. Here's a breakdown of their roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weights represent the parameters that the neural network learns during the training process. Each connection between neurons in adjacent layers is associated with a weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "During forward propagation, the input data is linearly transformed by these weights. Each input feature is multiplied by its corresponding weight, and the results are summed up. This weighted sum forms the basis for the activation of neurons in subsequent layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, weights determine the strength of connections between neurons, influencing how much importance each input feature has on the output of the neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Biases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Biases are additional parameters added to each neuron in the network (except input neurons) to adjust the output along with the weighted sum of inputs.\n",
    "Biases provide the network with flexibility by allowing it to model more complex functions. They enable the shifting of the activation function horizontally, affecting when the neuron \"fires\" or becomes active.\n",
    "Mathematically, biases allow the network to model relationships that do not necessarily pass through the origin (0,0) of the input space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Role Together:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both weights and biases are learned parameters during the training process, adjusted through techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs.\n",
    "They collectively enable the network to transform the input data non-linearly and model complex relationships within the data.\n",
    "The combination of weighted inputs and biases followed by the application of activation functions constitutes the core operation of forward propagation in a neural network."

    "\n",
    "3. Normalization: Softmax normalizes the output scores, ensuring that they sum up to 1. This property is crucial for probabilistic interpretation, as it guarantees that the output represents a valid probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Decision Making: In classification tasks, softmax facilitates decision making by selecting the class with the highest probability as the predicted class. This is typically done by taking the index of the highest probability in the output vector.\n",

At each layer, the local gradient of the activation function with respect to the weighted sum of inputs is multiplied by the gradient of the loss function with respect to the output of that layer (computed in the previous step), resulting in the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weighted sum of inputs of that layer.\n",
